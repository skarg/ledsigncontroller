# LED Sign Controller

Joshua and I worked to create a battery powered LED sign controller 
for a motorcycle helmet using an AVR microcontroller and 85 LEDs poked 
through a piece of cardboard in a 5 row by 17 column matrix.  

Joshua designed the LED matrix for each letter of the alphabet
on some notebook paper and then and wrote the C code for each letter.

I wrote the C code to play the phrases and do the scrolling and 
light the LEDs and manage the button presses to change the phrases.
